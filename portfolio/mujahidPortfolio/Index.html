<h2>About Me</h2>
<div class = Desc>
    <h3>Highschool Student | Aspiring Web Developer | Game Developer</h3>
    <p>My name is Mujahid Udofia. I am a 16 year old highschool senior and future web developer. I aspire to gain wide coding knowledge and become a competent web designer.</p>
    <p>As a kid ive always aspired to create. I learned how websites and games were made using programming and code and ever since then mastering programming has been my dream.

 I decided to take coding classes and apply for tech internships such as WeCode KC and Jreid Indeed. During my time at WeCode KC i developed basic coding skill and learned to work with a team. During my time at Jreid Indeed my coding skill had flourished and become more than just a basis. I learned insider knowledge in the tech space and figured out programs such as VS Code. 

I am still aspiring to be a Developer and I'm doing everything i can to strive toward that goal.</p>
