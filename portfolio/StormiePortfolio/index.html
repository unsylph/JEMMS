        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am an aspiring coder who likes working in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
        I like playing video games, reading, and making art in my free time. My mind has always
        been fascinated by programming languages' abilities to allow users to immerse themselves in fictional worlds.
        I hope to bring that same joy and inspiration to users by creating and designing a cozy RPG that inspires users. 
        I hope to build skills to create games through software development, learning new programming languages, 
        and storytelling through code.
