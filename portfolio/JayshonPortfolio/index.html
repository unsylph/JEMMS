      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p> Script Writer | Actor | Novice Coder | Video Editor and Filmmaker</p>
      <p>
        Passionate about storytelling through both lens and stage, I began my acting journey in my sophomore year and have been honing my craft ever since—combining performance with purpose. As a rising senior at Sumner Academy of Arts & Science, I bring a unique blend of charisma, discipline, and curiosity to every role I take on. Currently I am showing an interest in code and Cardiovascular health with JREID Indeed to broaden my knowledge and skillset.

        We're currently producing an animated video with Justin Reid to teach elementary school children about cardiac arrest and the importance of CPR through storytelling and visual learning.
        Our group even has a presentation and a website for further emphasis.
