    <div class="section">
            <p>My name is Mace Thompson!</p>
            <p>I love learning new things and pride myself on working with many things and picking stuff up easily; matching this, I take many Advanced Placement (AP) courses to sate my goal of knowledge. I disassemble programs and computers to figure out how they work. I'm skilled in web development utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; JavaScript is one of my strongest suits. I manage Linux-based systems remotely and directly daily, especially as I utilize Linux as my main operating system; due to usage of Linux, I know how to utilize command line and text editors like VIM very well.</p>
            <p>I've taken classes such as AP Computer Science Principles, AP Computer Science A, AP Environmental Science, AP Chemistry, AP Europeon History, AP US History, AP English Language, Dual Credit Pre-Calculus. I'm currently working at an internship at JReid InDeed managing a team to produce a website and video to promote awareness of cardiac arrest and what can be done during it.</p>
            <p>Outside of handling technology, I enjoy biking, taekwondo, weaving, improving my drawing, and playing games. I want to make a change to make the world more inclusive, accessible, and allow personal time.</p>
